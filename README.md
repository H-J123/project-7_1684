This project uses a CSV-based weather dataset containing daily records of temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and rain status for various Indian cities, and is intended to be implemented in Python with common data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn for preprocessing and model building. The main goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow (“RainTomorrow”) based on today’s meteorological conditions (“RainToday” and other features), enabling more informed planning for activities affected by rainfall, such as agriculture, travel, and city management.
